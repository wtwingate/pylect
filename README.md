# pylect

## About

`pylect` is a CLI program that searches the Sunday, Holy Day, and Commemoration Lectionary in the [Book of Common Prayer 2019](https://bcp2019.anglicanchurch.net/) for any upcoming holy days within a given date range and returns their corresponding Scripture lessons. When desired, it can then fetch the text of the Scripture lessons and automatically copy them to the system clipboard.
